# Village Culture
Lofty pursuits of a person with minimal coding experience.
### What is this?
This mod aims to give life to villagers and villages alike by deepening interactions between villagers.

This may range from 
- simulating economy and a sort of tribal government
- enabling actual physical village growth
- creating fresh and new professions
- generally making villagers less frustrating to work with

all while keeping a relatively "vanilla" feel.

Changes will be slow and minimal at first as my knowledge of java is limited, but I have big plans, so this will be a fantastic learning experience.
